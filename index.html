    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Shelby West, I like computers which is why I joined this field in the first place but I mostly like HTML and CSS even though I need a lot of improvement I am continuing to learn as i go.<br>
       <br>
        I go to Francis Howell Central and I am also attending The Lewis and Clark College and Career center in the Computer Software Development (CSD) class so I can learn about computer languages and be good at what I would like to do in the future
        which, Right now i am not exactly sure what position I would want when I get a job ,so I am willing to learn about what kind of job I would be passionate about and be willing to stick with.<br> 
        <br>
        I used to be in the Colorguard at Francis Howell Central and it taught me a lot about how important it is to ask for help and that being on a team is important to learning and getting things done quicker and efficiently. Even though I have a hard time talking to people I am not familiar with I will continue to work through it so I can work efficiently.
      </p>
    <h2>What I am good at</h2>
      <p>
        I am honestly better at HTML and CSS I will admit I am not as good at Javascript as I would like to be ,and will continue learning, so I would love a job that includes CSS or HTML.
        I am also working on learning how to edit videos, but I definitly need to work on learning more in depth on what I can add instead of just cutting out the stuff I don't like.

    <h2>What I have been working on</h2>
      <p>
        I have been posting YouTube videos every Friday as a personal project it gives me something to do if I am bored during the week and allows me to also work on lessening my anxiety.
        I have also been doing a lot of research on what video I would want to make which is very important because I want to post something that I enjoy doing. 
        For example, I really enjoy baking/cooking so i have been doing one cooking video a month. I also plan on working on anything I would like to get better at.
