      Hello! My name is Shelby West, I like computers which is why I joined this field in the first place though I mostly understand HTML and CSS even though I need a lot of improvement I am continuing to learn as i go.<br>
     <br>
      I go to Francis Howell Central High School and I am also attending The Lewis and Clark Career center in the Computer Software Development (CSD) class so I can learn about computer languages and be good at what I would like to do in the future
      which right now i am not exactly sure what position I would want when I get a job ,so I am willing to learn about what kind of job I would be passionate about.<br>

      <br>
      I used to be in the Colorguard at Francis Howell Central and it taught me a lot about how important it is to ask for help and that being on a team is important to learning and getting things done quicker and efficiently. Even though I have a hard time talking to people I am not familiar with I will continue to work through it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      I was born and raised in Saint Charles, Missouri and I love playing video games I mostly play Minecraft or League of Legends(I haven't really played League recently and I still need to get better at playing it). I eventually want to become an Information Technician or a full time Youtuber if it goes anywhere because I plan on filming some gaming content.
      I like coding and being in the CSD class I just don't see myself developing websites and stuff for the rest of my life and I look forward to finding a job I like and am willing to stick with for as long as possible.<br>
