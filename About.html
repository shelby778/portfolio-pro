      Hello! My name is Shelby West, I like computers which is why I joined this field in the first place though I mostly understand HTML and CSS even though I need a lot of improvement I am continuing to learn as i go.<br>
     <br>
      I go to Francis Howell Central High School and I am also attending The Lewis and Clark Career center in the Computer Software Development (CSD) class so I can learn about computer languages and be good at what I would like to do in the future
      which, Right now i am not exactly sure what position I would want when I get a job ,so I am willing to learn about what kind of job I would be passionate about and be willing to stick with.<br>

      <br>
      I used to be in the Colorguard at Francis Howell Central and it taught me a lot about how important it is to ask for help and that being on a team is important to learning and getting things done quicker and efficiently. Even though I have a hard time talking to people I am not familiar with I will continue to work through it so I can work efficiently.
      <br>
      You can also Check out my Github there isn't much on there right now but it might be worth checking out.

      <br>

      I was born and raised in Missouri the only people in my family that actually took intrest in electronics other than me is my dad ,who is a Mechanic ,and My Aunt who whenever I went over had some kind of electronic for me to mess with that had a bunch of games such as the Wii, Wii U, the computer,etc.
      and because I am young and like electronics my family kind of expects me to know everything there is to know about how to use any and every kind of phone and computer even though I don't I some how figure it out or they do but they forget what they did and the same goes for me sometimes.
