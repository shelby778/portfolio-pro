    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Shelby West, I like computers which is why I joined this field in the first place but I mostly like HTML and CSS even though I need a lot of improvement I am continuing to learn as i go.<br>
       <br>
        I go to Francis Howell Central and I am also attending The Lewis and Clark College and Career center in the Computer Software Development (CSD) class so I can learn about computer languages and be good at what I would like to do in the future
        which, Right now i am not exactly sure what position I would want when I get a job ,so I am willing to learn about what kind of job I would be passionate about and be willing to stick with.<br> 
        <br>
        I used to be in the Colorguard at Francis Howell Central and it taught me a lot about how important it is to ask for help and that being on a team is important to learning and getting things done quicker and efficiently. Even though I have a hard time talking to people I am not familiar with I will continue to work through it so I can work efficiently.
        <br>

        <br>
        I was born and raised here in Missouri the only people in my family that actually took intrest in electronics other than me is my dad who is a Mechanic and My Aunt who whenever I went over had some kind of electronic for me to mess with that had a bunch of games such as the Wii, Wii U, the computer,etc.
        but because I am young and like electronics my family kind of expects me to know everything there is to know about how to use any and every kind of phone and computer even though I don't I some how figure it out or they do but they forget what they did and the same goes for me.
      </p>
    <h2>What I am good at</h2>
      <p>
        I am honestly better at HTML and CSS I will admit I am not as good at Javascript as I would like to be ,and will continue learning, so I would love a job that includes CSS or HTML.
        I am also working on learning how to edit videos, but I definitly need to work on learning more in depth on what I can add instead of just cutting out the stuff I don't like.

    <h2>What I have been working on</h2>
      <p>
        I have been posting YouTube videos every Friday as a personal project it gives me something to do if I am bored during the week and allows me to also work on lessening my anxiety.
        I have also been doing a lot of research on what video I would want to make which is very important because I want to post something that I enjoy doing. 
        For example, I really enjoy baking/cooking so i have been doing one cooking video a month followed by other videos. I also plan on working on anything I would like to get better at.
