    <h2>What I am good at</h2>
      <p>
        I am honestly better at HTML and CSS I will admit I am not as good at Javascript as I would like to be ,and will continue learning, so I would love a job that includes CSS or HTML.
        I am also working on learning how to edit videos, but I definitely need to work on learning more in depth on what I can add instead of just cutting out the stuff I don't like.

    <h2>What I have been working on</h2>
      <p>
        I have been posting YouTube videos every Friday as a personal project it gives me something to do if I am bored during the week and allows me to also work on lessening my anxiety.
        I have also been doing a lot of research on what videos I would want to make which is very important because I want to post something that I enjoy doing. 
        For example, I really enjoy baking/cooking so i have been doing one cooking video a month followed by other videos. I also plan on working on anything I would like to get better at.
